THANK YOU for all the feedback so far! We've been working hard to add requested features, as well as polish up the app before the fall semester begins.

Changes
— Added “Edit Org” screen for admins.
— Added Unified Notifications
— Redesigned user profile to constantly display at bottom of screen
— Added menu indicators
—  Redesigned main menu to be more intuitive and useful
—  Removed header bar in favor of floating menu icons
— Reorganized navigation
— Changed text descriptions in various places (add org, etc..)
— Changed “event description” to “org description” text when creating new org
— Changed "email" to "org Email" where applicable
— Made login page more intuitive (easier to find Northeastern login)
— Lowered minimum iOS version to 10.3 (was 11.2)
— TONS of compatibility changes for the Android version (none of which hopefully are too visible in iOS)

Fixes
— Fixed issue on 5S-sized devices where User Registration tag picker clipped off screen
— Fixed issue where org names were rendered off screen (on plus devices usually)
— Fixed various photo uploading issues
— Made “selected tags” more visible on edit user panel
— Fixed buttons overlapping on iPhone 5s on Event Details page
— Slight padding on mini event
— Added max-width to mini events to prevent stretched look on horizontal views
— Fixed list of admins rendering strange on 5S/SE-devices
— Capitalized ‘p’ in “parade” on home screen
— Added padding on MiniEvents
— Fixed Back button
— Probably lots more…
