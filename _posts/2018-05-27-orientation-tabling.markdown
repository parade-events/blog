Every Northeastern student remembers the rush of emotion walking into the Activities Fair on the first night of orientation.  The moment feels so surreal, passing through the endless line of (literally) hundreds of different clubs.  I walked into mine having no idea which clubs I wanted to meet with, or really what to do.  I signed up for _dozens_ of emails lists, but ended up not finding any of the clubs that, today, I am really involved and interested in.

This fall, we will be launching parade's "Explore" page, which aims to serve as a "24/7 Activities Fair". With over 400+ clubs at Northeastern, it's impossible to get a chance to visit every table. We want students to be able to explore and discover _all_ the diverse clubs at this school, and without the 105 minute time-limit imposed by the Activities Fair.

_That said_, parade is going to be tabling alongside Northeastern's clubs at this year's activity fair!

The Activities Fair will take place on the following dates from **6:30 – 7:45 p.m.** on the Library Quad.

  * Monday, June 11
  * Monday, June 18
  * Monday, July 2
  * Monday, July 16
  * Monday, July 23
  * Monday, July 30

Parade will be on-campus to talk with students and introduce them to parade. We're very excited to get feedback on the work we've done so far, and are looking forward to getting some guidance on what else students want our platform to offer. **_We also may have some parade swag to hand out..._**

Check out the [Orientation Website][orientation-site] for more info on everything else that orientation has to offer!  Also be sure to check our [Instagram][instagram], where we will be spotlighting awesome clubs all throughout the summer!  

Most importantly, be sure to stop by our table during orientation and say hi!
