## What is Parade, anyway?

Glad you asked! [Parade](https://parade.events/) is the best way to discover events held by Northeastern's 400+ student-run organizations.  These student groups put incredible time and effort into fun and engaging events - we help you discover them!  Check out our [welcome guide](https://parade.events/welcome-guide/) for more detail on how to use our app, or read about us in our [News@Northeastern feature](https://news.northeastern.edu/2019/07/23/want-to-know-whats-happening-on-northeasterns-boston-campus-theres-an-app-for-that/).

Parade is created **entirely by current NU students**, and made possible due to our team's commitment to sharing the best of Northeastern with as many people as possible!
